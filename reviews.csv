ITEM,REVIEW
burger,"I ordered the burger with fries, and it was disappointing. The burger was overcooked, and the fries were soggy. Not worth the price"
sushi,The sushi was incredible! Fresh fish and perfectly seasoned rice. Will be my go-to sushi spot from now on.
pasta,"The pasta was underwhelming. The sauce lacked flavor, and the noodles were overcooked. Won't be returning."
